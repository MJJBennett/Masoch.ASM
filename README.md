### Assembly Interpreter

This is a very simple intrepreter written in assembly.

#### Notes

I've commented the code quite well, so this isn't really necessary, but it's possibly worth mentioning that this was written for 64-bit OS X (as, since macOS Catalina, 32 bit programs are no longer supported). The main changes are mostly minor, using different registers and syscalls than on 32-bit but otherwise a similar setup.
